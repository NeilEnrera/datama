                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Welcome to Here Pawr You, a platform created with love and dedication by 2nd-year IT students who share a deep passion for animal welfare. Our mission is simple yet powerful—to help lost pets reunite with their owners and to give stray dogs and cats a chance to find their forever homes.</p>
                
                <p>We understand the pain of losing a beloved pet, and we know that stray animals deserve love and care just as much as any other pet. That's why we created Here Pawr You—a place where missing pets can be found, where people can come together to help reunite lost companions, and where strays can find warmth, shelter, and the families they deserve.</p>
                
                <p>Through our website, we provide search tools, community support, and adoption services, making it easier for pet owners and animal lovers to connect. Whether you're looking for a lost pet, hoping to adopt, or wanting to make a difference in the lives of stray animals, we are here to support you every step of the way.</p>

                <p>At Here Pawr You, we believe that every paw matters. Together, we can bring pets home, give strays a new beginning, and create a kinder world for all animals.</p>
